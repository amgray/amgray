### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 
I'm Andy and I am (suprise suprise) a Software Developer.
I am UK based, currently living in the West Midlands.

I don't have a main language as such, I try to use the best solution for the problem at hand.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing and maintaining an Android Data Collection App written in Java; a C# Winforms App to analyse the said data (transferred via an encrypted data file), and storing this in a SQL Server Database; License management for the C# App and updates for the App and Database are done via an API to a Ruby on Rails Server application.

Previously I have used PHP (and obviously html and css), Delphi, MySQL, and PostGreSQL.

I have experience of developing and maintaining very large systems such as the Accounting system for BMW(UK), Motor Insurance Claims end to end processing for Aviva, AXA, and GroupAMA, as well as small systems for individual clients.
